ECE 346: Intelligent Robotic Systems is an undergraduate robotics course at Princeton University that combines foundational autonomy theory with hands-on practice on real robot trucks. Students learn core concepts in perception, planning, control, and safety while building and programming mobile robotic systems using the Robot Operating System (ROS).

The accompanying [ECE346 codebase on GitHub](https://github.com/SafeRoboticsLab/ECE346) provides a complete set of lab materials, development tools, simulation scaffolding, and robot interface code. It supports a sequence of labs that guide students from basic ROS fundamentals to advanced autonomy topics such as trajectory planning, collision avoidance, and imitation learning.

## Robotic Platform — 1/16-Scale Autonomous Truck
The hardware platform for ECE 346 consists of 1/16-scale ground robot trucks outfitted with onboard computation, sensors, and ROS connectivity. These mini autonomous vehicles serve as a physical testbed for core autonomy algorithms and allow students to iterate between simulation and real robot testing.

In the first-year offering of the course, we built 16 of these trucks:

## Minicity
In addition to the truck, we also built a test room for the course: a minicity with intersections, merge lanes, roundabouts, etc. The room is also equipped with SLAM for real-time localization:

## Codebase — ECE346 GitHub Repository

The [SafeRoboticsLab/ECE346](https://github.com/SafeRoboticsLab/ECE346) repository provides structured lab materials, ROS workspaces, and example packages used throughout the course.

**Lab Assignments**
A progressive set of labs designed to teach robotics fundamentals through practice:

* Lab 1: Introduction to ROS and basic truck operation
* Lab 2: ILQR trajectory planning
* Lab 3: Collision avoidance and dynamic environment navigation
* Lab 4: MDP/POMDP decision making fundamentals
* Lab 5: Imitation learning frameworks
(More modules may be added in future iterations.)

## Demo
The following figure shows the truck performing real-time iLQR to nagivate around the Minicity while following traffic rules and road boundaries:

## Press release
The course is now one of the core courses for the [Princeton's Minor in Robotics](https://robotics.princeton.edu/minor).

The university also wrote a press release on the course, found here: [Robot trucks drive students to solve real problems in modern robotics](https://ece.princeton.edu/news/robot-trucks-drive-students-solve-real-problems-modern-robotics)

## Acknowledgement
Throughout the development of the hardware platform, software stack, and lab materials for this course, I significantly expanded my own technical skill set and understanding of full-stack robotic systems. Many of these lessons have directly carried over to larger-scale and more complex robotics projects that I have since had the opportunity to work on.

I am grateful to Professor Jaime Fernández Fisac for the opportunity to take on this challenge, and to my collaborators [Zixu Zhang](https://zzx9636.github.io/) and [Kai-Chieh Hsu](https://kaichiehhsu.github.io/).
