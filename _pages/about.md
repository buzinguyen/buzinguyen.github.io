I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jaime Fernández Fisac](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac) in the [Safe Robotics Lab](https://saferobotics.princeton.edu/).

My research focuses on **scaling safe reinforcement learning for high-dimensional robotic systems**, enabling robots to operate robustly in the real world and collaborate effectively with humans. To this end, I develop learning and control frameworks that leverage **world models, adversarial imagination, and closed-loop foundation-model fine-tuning**, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical safety guarantees and real-world deployment. 

I ground my work in both academic and industrial settings, ranging from **closed-loop RL fine-tuning pipelines for autonomous driving** developed during my internship at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), to **real-time introspective safety mechanisms** field-tested in the [DARPA LINC program](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/learning-introspective-control).

<b><u>I am currently on the job market</u></b> and actively seeking full-time opportunities in robotics and autonomy, as well as research collaborations.
