Welcome to my learning hub. Here you will find a collection of technical books and study notes I am currently writing to document my learning process on topics including Linear Systems, Control Theory, and Robotics.

Most materials here are open-source works-in-progress, paired with code repositories to facilitate hands-on learning. I believe that knowledge grows when it is shared; as such, these materials are designed to be interactive—often accompanied by Jupyter Notebooks and Python implementations—to help myself and future readers visualize complex concepts.
